# this script was written on debian bullseye with TLS protocol version 1.2.
# the webpage 'https://theclergydatabase.org.uk' does not support TLS v. 1.2 or higher.
# If open-ssl is used for protocol encrytion the SECLEVEL parameter might (temporary) be set 
# from 2 to 1. On debian (and most likely on other UNIX architectures) this might be found in the corresponding
# config file: /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf [from command line or 'system' command in R: cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf | grep DEFAULT@SECLEVEL"]
